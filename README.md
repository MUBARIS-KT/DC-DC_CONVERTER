# DC to DC Converter

This project provides the complete design and code for a DC to DC converter that steps up 12V DC to 300V DC. The project is a comprehensive solution in power electronics, including PCB design, STM32 code for PWM generation, datasheets, design references, and the full converter design.

## Features

- **High Voltage Conversion**: Steps up 12V DC input to 300V DC output.
- **PCB Design**: Includes a custom PCB layout tailored for the converter.
- **STM32 PWM Generation**: Code for PWM signal generation to drive the converter.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Includes datasheets and design references for all components used.
- **Optimized for Power Electronics Applications**: Designed with efficiency and stability in mind, suited for high-voltage DC applications.

## Getting Started

This project is designed for use with STM32 microcontrollers and requires STM32CubeIDE for code development. The PCB design files are available and can be used with compatible design software.

### Prerequisites

- **STM32CubeIDE**: Required for programming and PWM generation.
